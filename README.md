Thanks to games like Narrow One being written as a HTML5 games, using "CSS Override" addons (my pick: Stylebot on Chrome Store - featured and top rated), you can customize the looks of it, with all the power CSS has in hand.

Works on this addon started around 2nd of November, when PING 18 [asked how to save CSS changes](https://discord.com/channels/519477170964267008/824943883178737715/1301959478337339422) while playing with DevTools inspector. He wasn't first to "inspect element" of the page for the funnies, but I happened so to be in the chat that day, and wanted to actually answer his question. My CSS experience at that time was ending on downloading Dark Reader and changing website fonts to my system's default, but I researched StyleBot addon, and I was having fun animating loadout icons. I started taking first steps into Tampermonkey as well, thus making FanTranslation addon.

The project eventually snowballed from a meme edit into something more: Lolopano took the FanTranslation template and made an actual game translation, more people began getting involved, and I figured more players might enjoy this setup - so I moved my memes to separate scripts and started working on Violent Glass (something that could be aesthetically pleasing: unified on a theme of glass and shades of violet). Stylesheets applied through Tampermonkey were less forgiving, which Pratik, Systummm and Slipper King helped me troubleshoot. Eventually it was diagnosed that Stylebot automatically adds "!important" tags on styles, which Tampermonkey doesn't, and it can be fixed.

Without Xeltalliv, this theme might as well remain existing as stylesheet for StyleBot - he contributes the most interesting part of this package: HealthBarPercentage.js, on top of that providing Quality of Life scripts. And without **you** - it'll

> All major customization features (including **optional** FanTranslation "Shitongue" present in this picture) are split into separate scripts, so players can add as many as they want, then toggle them effortlessly from Tampermonkey dashboard. For example: one could download Violent Glass, then cascade on top of it another stylesheet (e.g. something to change loadout backgrounds to animated .gif, more animations, etc.)

### Installation:

The process has been simplified for a common user that won't need adjustments:

1. Install Tampermonkey into your webbrowser (available in your webbrowser's Addon store), or one of its open-source alternatives.
2. Open [/Scripts](https://github.com/TheGirlThatLived/NarrowOne_Customizations/tree/main/Scripts) folder, and click on the scripts that you wanna install. Find a button to copy them as RAW file.

3. In Tampermonkey, create "New Script", **empty it's contents to blank page** (Ctrl+A -> Delete), then paste the copied script (repeat this step for every new script you're trying to import).

This is all you need to know to upgrade your Narrow One experience, but I hope it'll raise your curiosity to go around and try to edit this on your own.

What you do is you hover mouse over page elements while "inspect element" tool is enabled - that's how you find their names, to later reference in your external CSS stylesheet and list all effects you wanna add.
