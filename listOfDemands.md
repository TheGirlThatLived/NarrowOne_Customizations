[] 3rd Person Camera (not to confuse with 2nd Person Camera used for spectating) - The camera is swaying from left to right, player model often appearing in front of crosshair obstructing view. Camera needs to be fixed to position behind player character, and crosshair adjusted for the aim offset that occurs in this camera mode (preferably aiming point being in the center of screen same as for 1st person, to not confuse 3rd party HUD crosshairs).

[] New items in shop should receive "NEW!" badges, to disappear after player hovers mouse over them or clicks on them for "confirm purchase" window to appear (not requiring buying).

[] In-game chat: messages stored locally instead of disappearing after 4sec, ability to block users locally (blocked users stored in IndexedDB by their UserIDs (their unique public identifier derived from AccountID in a private-public key fashion and stored on server)).

[] More separate and distinctive audio cues for in-game events.

[] Bow1 "Scout" weapon class should be either removed, remade into something new (to not waste skin purchases), or headshotting ability taken away from it for balance purposes.

[] LOAD Stats rebalance: +5 LOAD is too much, affecting all bows.

[] ATK/ARM/STUN Stats rebalance: STUN is being useless most of time (thanks to Poosting), and less LOAD available would mean more stats spent on ATK.

[] Light Poke weapons are overpowered (poosting and Heavy Blade-comparable damage).

[] Heavy Poke weapons need rebalance.

[] Heavy Blunt with +3 ATK and more should have the ability to completely stun someone in place for a whole second.
